Build Wcat Command =? CAT command in linux clone

it is used to display or make a copy of one or more files in the terminal.

General Syntax
node wcat.js [options][Filepath]
option to remove big line break (-s)
option to add line number to non empty lines (-b)
option to add line number to all line (-n)

commands :
1- node wcat.js filepath=>displays content of that file on terminal
2- node wcat.js filepath1,filepath2,.... =>display content of all the files( concatenated/append form) on terminal
3- node wcat.js -s filepath   =>convert big line breaks into single line breaks
4-node wcat.js -n filepath => give numbering to all the lines
5-node wcat.js -b filepath  => give numbering to all the non empty lines

Edge Cases:
